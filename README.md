# Research & Innovation

Welcome to the **Research & Innovation** repository — the home for exploratory, forward-looking projects and proofs-of-concept (PoCs) involving cutting-edge technologies such as agentic AI, generative AI, and next-generation streaming architectures.

This repo contains independent research projects, experimental implementations, and architectural patterns that support enterprise-wide innovation efforts.

---

## Repository Structure

Each folder below represents a **research or experimental initiative**.

/agentic-ai — Projects related to agentic AI frameworks and multi-agent systems
/genai — Generative AI projects, models, and prompts
/streaming-nextgen — Streaming data innovations and next-gen real-time processing models

## Navigation & Contents

### **agentic-ai**
This folder houses research and PoCs focused on **agentic AI** — autonomous AI systems capable of multi-step reasoning and orchestration.

Typical contents:
- Experiment code
- Multi-agent architecture diagrams
- Notebook examples
- README with project details per subfolder

 Purpose: Explore multi-agent AI patterns, orchestration frameworks, and integration with Snowflake / Databricks services.

---

### **genai**
This folder contains **generative AI experiments**, demos, and frameworks:

- Prompt engineering artifacts
- Model evaluation notebooks
- End-to-end GenAI examples
- Integration patterns with Cortex, Mosaic, Polly, etc.

 Purpose: Validate GenAI use cases, benchmark models, explore inference workflows, and capture reusable design patterns.

---

### **streaming-nextgen**
This folder is dedicated to **next-generation streaming analytics**:

- Real-time ingestion
- Event-driven processing
- Kafka / Pub/Sub related research
- Stateful analytics examples

 Purpose: Investigate modern streaming architectures, patterns for low-latency analytics, and high-throughput pipeline designs.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by folder** to find the project of interest.
2. Inside each project, review the subfolder `README.md` for:
   - Project description
   - Data and runtime dependencies
   - How to run or reproduce results
   - Expected outputs and benchmarks
3. Iterative research work should reside in its own subfolder with:
   - Versioned notebooks
   - Config files
   - Architecture and diagrams
   - Test cases (if any)
4. Cite and link this repo in internal presentations, architectural docs, and tech briefs.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions and collaboration on research initiatives:

- **Feature branches:** Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feat/agent-orchestration`).
- **Commits:** Include a short summary and a detailed body.
- **Project READMEs:** Add a `README.md` in each project subfolder.
- **Code standards:** Format and lint scripts/notebooks where applicable.
- **Documentation:** Add architecture diagrams (Mermaid/PlantUML) whenever possible.

If your research matures into a reusable solution or accelerator, consider moving it into a dedicated **Solutions Hub** repository.
