# Research & Innovation – Asset Catalog

This catalog provides a structured inventory of **research, experiments, and innovation initiatives** housed in the `research-innovation` repository.

The focus of this repository is **exploration, prototyping, and future-ready architecture**, not production delivery. Mature assets may later graduate to Accelerators or Functional Solutions repositories.

---

## How to Use This Catalog

Use this catalog to:
- Discover ongoing research initiatives
- Identify reusable patterns and PoCs
- Understand maturity and ownership
- Avoid duplicate innovation efforts

You can search by:
- Topic (GenAI, Agentic AI, Streaming)
- Platform (Snowflake, Databricks, Kafka, Multi-cloud)
- Maturity (Exploratory, PoC, Advanced PoC)

### Next-Gen Streaming & Event-Driven Architecture

| Asset Name | Description | Platform | Maturity | Owner | Path |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|-------|------|
Streaming Architecture Patterns | Modern real-time data ingestion and processing | Kafka, Pub/Sub | Exploratory | Abhijit Das | `streaming-nextgen/` |
Event-Driven Analytics | Low-latency analytics and streaming joins | Multi-cloud | PoC | Abhijit Das | `streaming-nextgen/` |

---

## Maturity Definitions

| Level | Meaning |
|------|--------|
Exploratory | Early-stage experiments and research |
PoC | Working prototype demonstrating feasibility |
Advanced PoC | Enterprise-ready design with governance considerations |
Production-Candidate | Ready to move to Accelerator or Solution repo |

---

## Standard Metadata (Required per Project)

Each research project folder **should include a README.md** with:

Title:
Problem Statement:
Approach / Architecture:
Key Technologies:
Maturity:
Owner:
Last Updated:
Next Steps:

## Lifecycle & Graduation

- Research assets are **not guaranteed to be production-ready**
- Successful PoCs may be:
  - Promoted to **Accelerators**
  - Integrated into **Pre-sales demos**
  - Converted into **Functional Solutions**
- Archived research remains for reference and learning

---

## Ownership & Governance

- Each asset has a clear **owner**
- No client-specific or sensitive data allowed
- Synthetic or anonymized datasets only
- Periodic review to archive or promote work

---

## Related Repositories

- Functional Solutions
- Accelerators
- Pre-sales Demos
- Content & Enablement
